  We've found a bug for you!
  /home/bvihjcep/Projects/ancestor/lib/src/components/Ancestor_Base.res:34:3-12

  32 │ 
  33 │ let box = (~xxs=?, ~xs=?, ~sm=?, ~md=?, ~lg=?, ~xl=?, ()) =>
  34 │   Goober.css(
  35 │     ""
  36 │     ->greaterThan(#xxs, flexBasis(xxs))

  The module or file Goober can't be found.
  - If it's a third-party dependency:
    - Did you list it in bsconfig.json?
    - Did you run `rescript build` instead of `rescript build -with-deps`
      (latter builds third-parties)?
  - Did you include the file's directory in bsconfig.json?
